# Places of Worship Database System

## Project Vision

A comprehensive, extensible database system for tracking and analysing places of worship globally, designed to enable rigorous academic research into the spatial and temporal dynamics of religious communities and their regional interactions.

## Core Objectives

### Research Goals
- Enable spatial-temporal analysis of religious community evolution
- Support investigation of bidirectional relationships between places of worship and regional characteristics
- Provide robust data infrastructure for longitudinal studies of religious affiliation patterns
- Create reproducible research methodologies for cross-cultural religious geography studies

### Technical Goals
- Build future-proof, extensible architecture suitable for global deployment
- Integrate multiple data sources with automated quality validation
- Provide comprehensive temporal analysis capabilities including historical trend analysis
- Ensure academic research compliance with open data licensing requirements

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Place-Centric Data Model
Rather than relying on changing administrative boundaries, we anchor all data to specific places of worship. This approach:
- Avoids problems with changing regional boundaries over time
- Enables rich attribution of regional data to specific locations
- Supports heterogeneous data sources and future extensibility
- Facilitates temporal analysis without boundary dependency

### 2. Temporal Versioning Architecture
Every data change is tracked with full audit trails:
- Complete history of all attribute changes with timestamps
- Support for point-in-time queries across the entire dataset
- Automated change detection between data sources
- Manual annotation capabilities with reviewer tracking

### 3. Multi-Source Data Integration
Designed to handle diverse, potentially conflicting data sources:
- OpenStreetMap current and historical data
- Commercial APIs (Google Places, etc.)
- Census and demographic datasets
- Manual curation and research additions
- Automated conflict detection and resolution workflows

### 4. Academic Research Optimisation
Built specifically for research use cases:
- Read-heavy workload optimisation with spatial-temporal indexing
- Direct SQL access for complex analytical queries
- Full data provenance tracking for reproducibility
- Compliance with open data licensing for publication

## System Architecture

### Database Layer (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
- **Core Tables**: Places, temporal attributes, geographic regions
- **Temporal System**: Full versioning with valid-from/valid-to semantics
- **Spatial Integration**: PostGIS for efficient geographic queries and region associations
- **Performance**: Partitioned tables, composite indexes, materialised views

### Data Integration Pipeline
- **OSM Integration**: Current state import + historical change tracking
- **External Sources**: Google Places API, census data, research datasets
- **Quality Control**: Automated validation, conflict detection, manual review workflows
- **Change Detection**: Automated diffing between sources with confidence scoring

### API Layer
- **REST API**: Optimised for map tile serving and regional aggregations
- **Historical Queries**: Point-in-time and temporal range analysis endpoints
- **Research Access**: Direct database connections for complex analytical queries
- **Administrative Interface**: Data curation, quality review, manual annotation

### Frontend Interface
- **Interactive Maps**: Building on proven Leaflet implementations
- **Temporal Controls**: Historical timeline navigation and trend visualisation
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimised for field research and general access
- **Research Tools**: Query builders and data export capabilities

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: New Zealand Proof of Concept
- Implement complete system using existing NZ religious and demographic data
- Validate temporal analysis capabilities with available historical sources
- Establish data quality and performance benchmarks
- Create reproducible research methodology documentation

### Phase 2: Historical Data Integration
- Implement OSM historical import pipeline using Overpass API
- Create automated change detection and quality validation systems
- Establish manual review workflows for data curation
- Document legal compliance and attribution requirements

### Phase 3: Multi-Source Integration
- Integrate Google Places and census data sources
- Implement automated conflict resolution and confidence scoring
- Create external data validation and supplementation workflows
- Establish quality metrics and academic standards compliance

### Phase 4: Global Extensibility
- Design region-specific boundary and data integration strategies
- Create automated deployment and scaling capabilities
- Establish international data source integration frameworks
- Plan for long-term sustainability and institutional hosting

## Risk Management & Solutions

### Storage & Performance
**Challenge**: Historical versioning significantly increases database size  
**Solution**: Tiered storage with active/historical/archive partitions, selective detail levels for different time periods

### Data Quality
**Challenge**: OSM historical data contains mapping errors and vandalism  
**Solution**: Automated validation pipeline with confidence scoring, manual review workflows, external source cross-validation

### Legal Compliance
**Challenge**: Complex licensing requirements across multiple data sources  
**Solution**: Comprehensive provenance tracking, clear attribution workflows, academic use compliance documentation

### Scalability
**Challenge**: Global deployment requires significant infrastructure  
**Solution**: Docker-based deployment, local/cloud flexibility, read replica architecture for analytical workloads

## Research Applications

### Temporal Analysis
- Track formation, dissolution, and denomination changes of religious communities
- Analyse correlation between regional demographic changes and place of worship evolution
- Study impact of major events (migration, economic changes) on religious community geography

### Spatial Analysis
- Investigate regional clustering patterns and denominational geography
- Analyse accessibility and service area coverage for different communities
- Study urban/rural differences in religious community dynamics

### Comparative Studies
- Cross-national comparison of religious geography patterns
- Longitudinal studies of secularisation and religious community resilience
- Impact assessment of policy changes on religious community distribution
