# Stack Optimization Plan: R + Pure Static
*Created: 2025-08-27*
*Status: Ready for implementation*

## Current Assessment
Your project is already 90% optimal for academic research. You're using R for data processing (perfect) and have a clean static frontend (ideal). The Python FastAPI is the only unnecessary component.

## Proposed Changes (Minimal Effort - ~1.5 hours total)

### Phase 1: Remove Python Dependencies (30 minutes)
- Delete the `api/` directory (only contains basic FastAPI boilerplate)
- Update any documentation that references the Python API
- Remove Python-specific deployment configurations

### Phase 2: Optimize Development Workflow (15 minutes)  
- Add simple server start script for development
- Document recommended local development setup
- Ensure CORS issues are resolved for local development

### Phase 3: Enhance R Pipeline (45 minutes)
- Review existing R scripts (they're already excellent)
- Ensure all JSON outputs are optimized for frontend consumption
- Add any missing data validation/quality checks
- Document the R → JSON → JavaScript data flow

## Final Stack Architecture
```
R Scripts           →  JSON Files      →  Static Frontend
├── Stats NZ APIs   →  ├── demographics.json   →  ├── HTML/CSS/JS
├── Data cleaning   →  ├── places.json        →  ├── Leaflet maps  
├── Calculations    →  ├── boundaries.json    →  ├── Plotly charts
└── Export JSON     →  └── metadata.json     →  └── GitHub Pages
```

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Academic credibility**: R is the expected tool for statistical research
- **Zero server costs**: Pure static hosting on GitHub Pages
- **Reproducible research**: All processing documented in R scripts
- **Easy collaboration**: Any researcher can run your R scripts locally
- **Future-proof**: No framework dependencies to become obsolete
- **Performance**: Direct file serving is extremely fast

## Why R + Static is Perfect for Academic Research

### R Advantages for your use case:
- ✅ **Stats NZ integration** - Your R scripts already handle API calls beautifully
- ✅ **Statistical computing** - Built for demographic analysis
- ✅ **Reproducible research** - Scripts document your methodology  
- ✅ **Academic standard** - Expected in research contexts
- ✅ **Data transformation** - Excellent JSON export capabilities

### Static Frontend Advantages:
- ✅ **University hosting friendly** - No server requirements
- ✅ **Reliable** - Can't crash, no dependencies to break
- ✅ **Fast** - Direct file serving, cached by CDNs
- ✅ **Collaborative** - Easy for other researchers to use
- ✅ **Citation friendly** - Stable URLs for academic papers

## Current R Scripts Analysis (Already Excellent)
Your existing R scripts are perfectly structured for academic research:

- `fetch_age_gender_nz.R` - Stats NZ API integration
- `fetch_employment_income_nz.R` - Economic indicators
- `fetch_ethnicity_density_nz.R` - Cultural demographics
- `fetch_ta_religion_data.R` - Religious affiliation data
- `convert_ta_data_format.R` - Data format standardization
- Plus 3 more specialized demographic scripts

These represent best practices for reproducible research and should be kept as the backbone of your data pipeline.

## Effort Required Summary
This is primarily removing unnecessary Python code rather than building new functionality. Your R scripts and frontend are already excellent for academic research purposes.

**Refactoring effort: Minimal (1.5 hours)**
- Current Python usage is negligible (~200 lines of FastAPI boilerplate)
- No critical business logic to migrate
- Pure static frontend already works perfectly
- R data processing pipeline is already optimal

## Implementation Priority
1. **Immediate**: Fix current loading errors (revert breaking changes)
2. **Next**: Remove unnecessary Python FastAPI dependencies  
3. **Future**: Enhance R pipeline with additional demographic analysis
4. **Long-term**: Add more sophisticated statistical analysis features
