# tiles-r2

Serving and upload tooling for the map tiles, migrated to Cloudflare R2 on 2026-07-22.

- `worker/` — the `pow-tiles` Cloudflare Worker: serves PMTiles range reads from the `pow-tiles` R2 bucket with edge caching, routed at `tiles.placemap.org`. Deploy with `wrangler deploy` from `worker/`.
- `upload_r2.py` — uploads PMTiles archives to the bucket via the S3 multipart API; requires `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in the environment (the S3 secret is derived from it).

The tile archives themselves (`places.pmtiles`, `places-overview.pmtiles`, `buildings.pmtiles`, `nz-polygons.pmtiles`, plus the mbtiles intermediates they were converted from) are deliberately untracked: the live copies are in R2, and local rollback copies were moved to `~/tiles-archive-2026-07/tiles-migration/` when this tooling was rescued from the untracked `.tiles-migration/` staging directory on 2026-08-14.
